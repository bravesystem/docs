## Feature Roadmap

BRaVe is in active development, is currently undergoing testing, with an initial open-source release planned for April 2026.

## History of BRaVe

The first version of BRaVe, a fully static desktop-based version, was launched in 2014 and has seen continued use since then. More recently a mobile version, internally referred to as BRaVe 2, was piloted. In 2025, development began in BRaVe 3, a comprehensive rearchitecturing and rebuild of the system, replacing both version 2 and 3.
